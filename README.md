# Barbershop Web System | UX-Driven Fullstack

> **"A clean interface is like a good haircut: it changes how you see the world."**

## The "User-First" Philosophy
Inspired by the immersive menus of story-driven adventure games, I focused on:
* **Visual Hierarchy:** Guiding the eye exactly where it needs to go.
* **Clean Motion:** Built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS** for a snappy, modern feel.
* **Responsive Soul:** Whether you're on a desktop or a phone, the experience remains premium.

## Technical DNA
This project was handcrafted on a **Manjaro Linux** environment, fueled by lo-fi beats and a focus on clean code.

* **Frontend:** React.js (Vite) + Tailwind CSS.
* **Backend:** Node.js & Express.
* **Database:** MongoDB (Cloud Connectivity via Atlas).
* **Tools:** Git, VS Code, and a lot of terminal debugging.
